Simple Website Demo

Instructions for Creating a Simple Website Using GhPages!

## 1) Create a new repository
Go to your GitHub profile and, under "Repositories," click the green button on the upper right hand side. Give it a name and then click create!

## 2) Create a new file
Under "Quick Setup," you'll see a link to do so. We're going to be working with HTML and CSS, so go ahead and make an HTML file.

Name your file something like `index.html`
Then add some HTML code. Or copy the basic HTML from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp below:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

You'll have to "Commit" your file with a title. You could put something like "first commit."

## 3) Go into Settings and enable GhPages

In the GitHub Pages section, change "Source" from "None" to "master branch."


Now you can access your webpage by visiting 

For example, my GitHub username is "veronicanutting" and I can access my "testingmba" page by going to: https://veronicanutting.github.io/testingmba/index.

Try it for yourself! Note that it can take up to 10 minutes to "build" or update your website.
